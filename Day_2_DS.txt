1. Write the program for deleting an element from the beginning and from any position.
//deleting from beginning
for(i=0;i<=n-1;i++)
	a[i]=a[i+1]
	
	
//deleting from any position	
int pos,arr[],n,i;
printf("Enter the position of the element to be deleted ");
scanf("%d",&pos)	
for (i= pos - 1; i< n - 1; i++)
    arr[i] = arr[i+1];


2. Write the program for printing the array after rotating it k times towards left, where k would be taken as user input.

for(i=0;i<k;i++)
	first=arr[0];
	for(j=0;j<n-1;j++)
		arr[j]=arr[j+1];
	arr[n-1]=first
